# react-mapbox

Repository contains a React application featuring the Mapbox mapping platform. The application features react-router and redux. The prupose of the application is to create an interactive journal to map and save locations where you have traveled. 

I've always wanted a map hanging on my wall with a pins stuck in it that represent places I've been. Then I thought, why not just make an app for that? Please feel free to contribute.
